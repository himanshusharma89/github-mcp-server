# GitHub MCP Server

This repository provides a production-ready [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server for GitHub, maintained by InfraCloud and authored by [Himanshu Sharma](https://github.com/himanshusharma89).

This MCP server exposes a set of secure, stateless tools for listing, searching, and creating GitHub issues and pull requests, and more. It is designed for easy integration with LLM agents and automation frameworks.
